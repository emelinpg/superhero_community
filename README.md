# Superhero Community
### Synopsis
I created this responsive web site using both front-end and back-end development. The reason why the website was created was to make an online community where real life superheroes could communicate with each other.

### Motivation
I was inspired to create a superhero community after watching an anime. I thought it would be a cool idea to create a website were real life super heroes could see what's going on locally and worldwide, see their rankings side by side with other heroes and even contact each other.
