### Motivation
I was motivated to create a website where you can find people that are intrested in the same things you are! This website will make it easier for people to explore all the pop culture news, find new friends, and even find local stores or upcoming events around your location!

### API Reference
I wanted users to be able to find local events, comic book stors or upcommig events around them, this is why I decided to use the [Google Map API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/adding-a-google-map). Also under the cool featured tab I used the [l33t sp34k](https://market.mashape.com/montanaflynn/l33t-sp34k).
as a translator to make the user sound cool!
